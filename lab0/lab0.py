# This is the file you'll use to submit most of Lab 0.

# Certain problems may ask you to modify other files to accomplish a certain
# task. There are also various other files that make the problem set work, and
# generally you will _not_ be expected to modify or even understand this code.
# Don't get bogged down with unnecessary work.


# Section 1: Problem set logistics ___________________________________________

# This is a multiple choice question. You answer by replacing
# the symbol 'fill-me-in' with a number, corresponding to your answer.

# You get to check multiple choice answers using the tester before you
# submit them! So there's no reason to worry about getting them wrong.
# Often, multiple-choice questions will be intended to make sure you have the
# right ideas going into the problem set. Run the tester right after you
# answer them, so that you can make sure you have the right answers.

# What version of Python do we *recommend* (not "require") for this course?
#   1. Python v2.3
#   2. Python v2.5 or Python v2.6
#   3. Python v3.0
# Fill in your answer in the next line of code ("1", "2", or "3"):

ANSWER_1 = '2'
